| deps.edn  has deprecated referencing outside project directories "../xxx" and so polycan only work either by symlinks or a root deps.edn.

I really don't know enough about polylith to comment much. you can just use clj to run shadow-cljs, there is no need to use the shadow-cljs command if it doesn't do what you need it to do
